# Allocation Rubric Processor

## Overview  
This project automates the aggregation, scoring, and benchmarking of academic data across multiple Excel files tied to HEGIS Codes (Higher Education General Information Survey). It calculates and standardizes metrics related to Instructional Effort, Student Success, and Student Engagement ‚Äî producing a clean, presentation-ready Excel report.

> ‚è±Ô∏è **Eliminates 1.5 to 2 weeks of manual data processing** ‚Äî transforming what once required days of copy-pasting and formatting into a seamless operation completed in minutes.

## How It Works

### 1. Directory Setup  
- Prompts user to enter a base folder path  
- Searches for Excel files based on specific naming patterns

### 2. Filter HEGIS Codes  
- Parses files like `INSTRUCTIONAL_FTE_*.xlsx`  
- Extracts rows from the `'Pivot Table NEW CALC FTE'` sheet  
- Filters by a predefined list of HEGIS Codes  
- Adds a **"STANDARD" row** for benchmarking  
- Saves to `FINAL_OUTPUT.xlsx` ‚Üí `'Filtered HEGIS Codes'` sheet

### 3. Instructional Effort  
- Reads `INSTRUCTIONAL_EFFORT_PART_1.xlsx` and `_PART_2.xlsx`  
- Extracts and merges columns from `'Summary Table'` sheets  
- Calculates total Instructional Effort score  
- Adds a "STANDARD" benchmark row  
- Merges results and formats to 2 decimal places

### 4. Student Success  
- Processes `SUCCESS_PART_1.xlsx` and `_PART_2.xlsx`  
- Merges and calculates Success scores  
- Adds "STANDARD" row and formats data

### 5. Student Engagement  
- Reads `FS_A_updated.xlsx` and `HIP_B.xlsx`  
- Extracts from `'Flattened Data'` sheets  
- Merges and calculates Engagement scores  
- Adds benchmark row and updates report

### 6. Final Scoring  
- Calculates:
  - **Rubric Total Score**
  - **Rubric Total Score ‚Äì HBG**
  - **Rubric Total Score ‚Äì USMGC**

- Standardizes scores relative to "STANDARD" row  
- Outputs final metrics:
  - `Rubric Standardized Score`  
  - `Rubric Standardized Score ‚Äì HBG`  
  - `Rubric Standardized Score ‚Äì USMGC`

- Final results written to `FINAL_OUTPUT.xlsx`
